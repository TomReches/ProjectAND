Scope:
The scope for this android app is to make the process for selecting a food recipe easier and more convenient. 

Problem: 

The problem arises from my mother. She knows her budget and the main ingredients she wants to use for her highly anticipated dinner for the whole family. However, she finds the selecting process for a recipe long and tiresome. When using Google, too many options pops up, and the recipes are mixed between ads and other websites the algorithm finds suitable. Sometimes she gives up and starts scrolling in her old recipe books. Moreover, people tend to search for something they know, something familiar, this results in a lack of variation. 
Solutions: 
As a result, an Android app is made where it is possible to find a recipe with a few factors. The main idea is that the app finds a random recipe. It is possible to write some few variables that the algorithm takes into consideration, but the main concept is that the app chooses a recipe for you, therefore the name: Hvad Skal Jeg spise I dag? (What should I eat today?) The random concept also provides the users with a large variation of new recipes that they normally would not find.
